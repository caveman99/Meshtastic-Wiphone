# Meshtastic-Wiphone
Variant files for partial Wiphone support.

Drop them into `/variants/wiphone` directory in the Meshtastic firmware repository. Move the wiphone.json file to the /boards directory
This will add partially working wiphone target as private hardware.
This effort may be merged with the main firmware once it is fully working.

Supported: LORA Backplate (RF95H based)
